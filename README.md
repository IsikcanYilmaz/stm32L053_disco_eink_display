This is the first thing I did for the STM32L053 Discovery Dev board that I got my hands on recently. 

Done in the Keil IDE using the HAL libraries. 

Run the python program ./eink_thing_client.py for the photo conversion functionality. Browse for a jpg file, move the slider around to get a decent black and white threshold, click transfer to transfer the compressed picture to your STM32L053. 

The result is something like what you see above; the picture of my face on the e-ink display.
